My path began in school, when I was studying electronics and discovered Arduino; that's where I understood that programming made me feel at home. Later I worked with Unity, and from that moment I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to building digital experiences capable of surprising.",
      "description2": "My style is modern minimalist, with a preference for well-defined components, large borders (rounded-4xl) and clean compositions. However, I also enjoy trying alternative styles loaded with color, visual effects and creative approaches outside the traditional."
