      "description": "Leading the frontend architecture and development of ChefSync, my own SaaS point-of-sale system built with Next.js and React. Created a highly interactive single-page application (SPA) with real-time data updates and full offline capabilities using local-first strategies. Designed and implemented 'ChefManager', a custom hardware integration enabling silent thermal printing directly from the browser via a Python/Flask local server (win32print on Windows, pycups on Linux), supporting ESC/POS text/images and seamless frontend API calls. Architected a unified UI Design System with Tailwind CSS and reusable components, reducing development time by 40%. Built responsive, mobile-first interfaces with a focus on performance, accessibility, and UX best practices. Collaborated on Figma-to-Code workflows, translating complex designs into clean, maintainable TypeScript code. Engineered a Local-First sync engine (Zustand + TanStack Query) achieving 60% faster load times through Vite optimizations and 100% offline uptime.",
