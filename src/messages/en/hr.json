I have also created solutions for pest control and an application aimed at improving reading comprehension in Colombia. Additionally, I have incorporated data analysis tools such as Google Analytics and Firebase to evaluate the impact of my applications and continuously improve the user experience. I have developed dashboards to monitor performance, enabling data-driven decision making. To ensure project quality and efficiency, I implemented agile methodologies, promoting collaboration and constant communication within the team. I integrated CI/CD practices, which helped reduce deployment times and improve software delivery efficiency. My focus is on creating technological solutions that address real-world needs and contribute to social development. I always look for new opportunities to innovate, learn new tools and collaborate on projects that have a positive impact on the community.",
